# Not The Hidden Wiki - Community Projects

Welcome to the place where you can share your project! How to do it?

* Create a directory in **Community Projects** with the name of your project for example **Super Project** 
* Inside it, create a README.md file in which you describe your project (remember to state at the top that you are the author and add links to your social media etc.)
* If you want/can, add other necessary files and materials to the directory
* Let the entire community know about your project on discord!
