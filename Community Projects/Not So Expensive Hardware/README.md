## Introduction
**Led by Marcin Motwicki (NOMAD)** and supported by a vibrant community, "Not So Expensive Hardware" is an initiative designed to make hardware creation accessible, affordable, and beginner-friendly. 
The goal is to build and share functional electronics using inexpensive, easily sourced components, with a strong focus on education and collaboration. 
This project aims to empower enthusiasts and beginners alike, showing them that building their own hardware doesn’t have to break the bank.  

## Resources and Accessibility
Every project will be shared in English, ensuring inclusivity for a broader audience. Comprehensive step-by-step guides will accompany each creation, making it easy for anyone to replicate the process. 
These guides will include detailed explanations, links to components, and all necessary files, such as 3D-printable designs and PCB schematics. 
Additionally, to help beginners overcome potential challenges, all critical steps—like soldering or assembling complex components—will be demonstrated through video tutorials shared on YouTube.  

## Community-Driven Approach
The project thrives on community involvement. Everyone is invited to contribute ideas, offer feedback, or even collaborate on new designs. By creating an open and supportive environment, the community can work together to refine existing projects or develop entirely new ones. The open-source approach ensures that all files and resources are freely available for anyone to use, modify, or improve.  

## Transparent Costing & Focus Areas
To make the experience as seamless as possible, the guides will also include transparent costing and links to affordable parts, ensuring budget-conscious builders know exactly what to expect. The project will focus on practical, modular designs that are perfect for beginners while still offering room for creativity and innovation. Many of the designs will replicate existing tools and devices, but we'll achieve them at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, we'll create entirely new designs based on community demand, ensuring the project evolves with the needs and interests of its participants.

## Mission and Vision
Ultimately, "Not So Expensive Hardware" is about more than just building devices—it’s about learning, sharing, and proving that creating your own hardware is within reach for anyone willing to give it a try. With detailed resources, hands-on videos, and the support of a passionate community, this project aims to make DIY electronics enjoyable and accessible to all.
